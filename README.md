## How to Use

### Creating an Image Processing Workflow

1. **Upload Image**: Drag the "Upload Image" component to the workspace, then drag an image file into it
2. **Add Processing Steps**: Drag "Image Filter" and/or "Image Repair" components between upload and preview
3. **Configure Settings**: Adjust filter settings (white balance, exposure) and repair settings (detail level)
4. **Preview Results**: The preview component shows the processed image, metadata, and all applied settings
5. **Execute Workflow**: Click "Run Workflow" to process the image through ComfyUI (requires ComfyUI running)

### Available Components

- **Upload Image** (üìÅ): Drag-and-drop image upload with metadata extraction
- **Image Filter** (üé®): Adjust white balance (-100 to 100) and exposure (-100 to 100)
- **Image Repair** (üîß): Enhance image details (0 to 100)
- **Preview** (üñºÔ∏è): View processed image with metadata and processing settings

### Workflow Rules

- **Upload is required**: Must be the first component
- **Preview is required**: Must be the last component
- **Filter/Repair are optional**: Can be added between upload and preview
- **Processing steps require upload**: Filter and repair components only work after an image is uploaded

### Controls

- **Save**: Save the current workflow to browser localStorage
- **Load**: Load the previously saved workflow
- **Clear**: Clear all components from the workspace
- **Export**: Download the workflow as a JSON file
- **Run Workflow**: Execute the workflow on ComfyUI (requires ComfyUI connection)
- **Zoom Controls**: Use +, -, and Reset buttons to control zoom level

### Image Upload Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Drag image files directly into the upload component
- **File Selection**: Click to select image files from your computer
- **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts file name, size, dimensions, and type
- **Image Preview**: Shows thumbnail of uploaded image

### Preview Component Features

- **Image Display**: Shows the processed image
- **Metadata Display**: Shows file information (name, size, dimensions, type)
- **Settings Summary**: Lists all applied filter and repair settings with values
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates automatically when settings change

## ComfyUI Integration

1. Install and run ComfyUI on your local machine
2. Ensure ComfyUI is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8188`
3. The app will automatically detect the connection and show "Connected" status

### Workflow Execution

1. Create your image processing workflow
2. Upload an image
3. Configure filter and repair settings
4. Click "Run Workflow" to execute on ComfyUI
5. Check ComfyUI for the processed results
